        Our project aims to utilize participatory mapping to facilitate the tracking and reporting of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) encounters within the United States. As tensions surrounding immigration policies continue to rise, these encounters often result in traumatic experiences, including unlawful searches, detentions, and violations of civil rights.

    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
        The focus of this project is to help individuals and communities identify and monitor areas where potentially dangerous or unlawful treatment of residents may be occurring.

    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
        Unlawful searches have been a significant concern during ICE operations, particularly in homes and workplaces. Many individuals report being subjected to invasive and unjust searches without a proper warrant or probable cause.

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; color: #1976d2;">Goals:</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
        Our project seeks to provide users with a platform to report and track ICE incidents in real time. By contributing data to this map, users can highlight areas where ICE operations are happening, potentially unlawful searches are occurring, and civil rights are being violated. 
    </p>

    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
        Through participatory mapping, individuals can document their experiences, raise awareness, and help build a clearer picture of where these incidents are happening.
